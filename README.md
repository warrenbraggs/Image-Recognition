# Image-Recognition
Image Rec repository in Python with OpenCv


## Face_detection.py

face_detection.py is a simple Face Recognition system to detect any face in a image using webcam.

To execute the code, you will need to install OpenCv (https://opencv.org/releases/) and the CascadeClassifer file (https://github.com/opencv/opencv/blob/master/data/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml).
The CascadeClassifer file reported above allows the webcam to operate and it should be allocated in the project directory.


## Face_detection.py

face_detection_live.py is a simple Face Recognition system to detect any face in a real-time by using the webcam.
As in the Main.py, you will need to install OpenCv and the CascadeClassifer file. 


## Text_detection.py

text_detection.py is a simple Text Detection system to find the letters in a image.
To execute the file, you will need OpenCv and pytesseract (https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)


## Text_detection_live.py

text_detection_live.py is a simple Text Detection system to find the letter in a real time frame.
To exectute the file, you will need to install OpenCv and pytesseract as above.
